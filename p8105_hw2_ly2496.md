This data set contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects the trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The data set
contains information per year, month, and trash collected include some
specific kinds of trash. The variables included in this data set is
dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards,
plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles,
grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls, homes\_powered. There are a
total of 344 observations in the final data set. The data set has
information from 2014 to 2019. Additional data sheets include month
precipitation data.

The total precipitation for 2018 is 70.33(in) and the median number of
sports balls in the dumpster in 2017 is 8.

\#\#describing the data set

The data sets are sourced from the FiveThrityEight website and we used
three data sets in the code above. The variables in the unemployment
dataset are year, unemployment\_pct, month\_name. There is a total of
816 observations in this data set. The data set contains information
from the year 1948 to the year 2015. Between this time range, the mean
percent of unemployment is 5.83. There is a total of 6 missing values in
this data set.

The other data set (snp\_df) is about stock values. The variables in
this data set are year, month\_name, close and there is a total of 787
observations in this data set. The variable “close” means the closing
values of the S\&P stock index on the associated date. The data in the
data set ranges from 1950 to 2015. The mean closing value for this time
period is 474.8887404 with a minimum of 17.049999 and a max of
2107.389893. There is a total of 0 missing values in this data set.

The third data set (month\_pol\_df) is about the number of national
politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time. The
variables in this data set are year, month\_name, gov\_gop, sen\_gop,
rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president and there is a total
of 822 observations in this data set. The data in the data set ranges
from 1947 to 2015. There is a total of 0 missing values in this data
set.

When combining all three data sets together, the resulting data set
consists of 822 observations. The variables in this data set are year,
month\_name, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem,
president, close, unemployment\_pct after combining by year and month.
The resulting dataset have a total of 48 missing values.
